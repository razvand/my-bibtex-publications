	Abstract = {{With the rapid development of P2P network technology, the share of P2P
		Internet traffic is growing among the total internet traffic. Because of
			the complex structure of P2P network and its protocals is flexible, most
			of the traditional P2P simulations simulate P2P protocols. This paper
			presents a distributed P2P users' action simulation system which is able
			to flexibly configure the content and P2P users' action sequence.
			Meantime, the system can simulate the execution progress of the action
			sequence of the P2P network for multiple users with generated data
			traffic containing specific content. At the same time, the system also
			provides rich users' action sequence templates, and records the
			execution progress and corresponding results. Experiments show that the
			system can simulate real users' action P2P sequence through simple and
			flexible configuration.}},
