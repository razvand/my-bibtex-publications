	abstract = {OS design is traditionally heavily intertwined with protection mechanisms. OSes statically commit to one or a combination of (1) hardware isolation, (2) runtime checking, and (3) software verification early at design time. Changes after deployment require major refactoring; as such, they are rare and costly. In this paper, we argue that this strategy is at odds with recent hardware and software trends: protections break (Meltdown), hardware becomes heterogeneous (Memory Protection Keys, CHERI), and multiple mechanisms can now be used for the same task (software hardening, verification, HW isolation, etc). In short, the choice of isolation strategy and primitives should be postponed to deployment time.We present FlexOS, a novel, modular OS design whose compartmentalization and protection profile can seamlessly be tailored towards a specific application or use-case at build time. FlexOS offers a language to describe components' security needs/behavior, and to automatically derive from it a compartmentalization strategy. We implement an early proto-type of FlexOS that can automatically generate a large array of different OSes implementing different security strategies.},

However, they are infamous for making it hard and extremely time consuming to extract such performance, and for needing significant engineering effort in order to port applications to them. We introduce Unikraft, a novel micro-library OS that (1) fully modularizes OS primitives so that it is easy to customize the unikernel and include only relevant components and (2) exposes a set of composable, performance-oriented APIs in order to make it easy for developers to obtain high performance.Our evaluation using off-the-shelf applications such as nginx, SQLite, and Redis shows that running them on Unikraft results in a 1.7x-2.7x performance improvement compared to Linux guests. In addition, Unikraft images for these apps are around 1MB, require less than 10MB of RAM to run, and boot in around 1ms on top of the VMM time (total boot time 3ms-40ms). Unikraft is a Linux Foundation open source project and can be found at www.unikraft.org.},

	abstract  = {As more and more software products are developed daily, the security risks imposed by the growing code bases increase. To help mitigate the risk, memory safe systems programming languages, such as D and Rust, are increasingly adopted by developers. The D programming language uses, by default, a garbage collector for memory management. If the performance of a program is bottle-necked by it, or a system is resource constrained, as is the case for the ever-growing Internet of Things devices, the user has the option opt out and employ a custom allocation strategy. However, in this situation, the programmer needs to manually manage memory - a complex and error-prone task. An alternative is represented by a middle ground solution in the form of automatic reference counting. This strategy offers simplicity and performance for a small cost in expressiveness. However, due to the transitive nature of type qualifiers in D and purity-based optimizations, it is impossible to implement a library solution. In this paper, we present the problems introduced by transitive type qualifiers to reference counting and we propose the addition of a new storage class for members of aggregate declarations that breaks the transitivity of type qualifiers. We present our design and show that it can be used to implement a generic automatic reference counting mechanism without disabling purity based optimizations.},

Aside from generating significant speedups of everyday procedures, OCR has a considerable role in the preservation of historical sources of information. Most of the World War 2 (WW2) documents are of great importance, especially with applications in virtual archives, museums, and research. The situation asks for an efficient, yet not aggressive, transcribing method using OCR tools. This paper describes an approach in the context of the given problem. The focus is oriented towards extracting the information from documents affected by their age, but with simpler structures, mainly split into paragraphs, such as letters and military reports. The approach is based on combining the results of multiple OCR engines, with the final objective of achieving better performance compared to the individual performance of each engine.},

	title = {A Framework for Analyzing {GPU}-Executed Malware},
	abstract = {Graphics processing units (GPU) are an integral part of today's computing environment. The marketing emphasis on user experience pushes vendors to constantly look for better graphics hardware and newer drivers to integrate into their products. Most commodity GPUs function as accelerators for image and video processing tasks and are present (either as dedicated or integrated form factor) in everyday devices including desktops, laptops, smartphones or other portable gadgets. Recent trends have seen the GPU move to perform additional tasks such as offloading some of the computation from the CPU or solve highly parallel problems. As GPUs become more powerful and widespread they will naturally become a very attractive target for attackers. Cybercriminals will look for any vulnerability in the GPU hardware or software, and will try to use it as an attack vector to compromise the system. This paper presents some of the incidents that involve the use of GPUs to perform malicious actions and proposes a framework to allow analysts to inspect the code executed on the GPU and trigger security alerts. The proposed solution will look at the processes running inside an operating system, it will identify which of them require access to the GPU and will try to intercept and scan for any suspicious activities, similar to a conventional security solution.},
